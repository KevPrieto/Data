# 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Advanced DAX Metrics

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** and a `.pbix` file developed as part of an **Advanced DAX course on Udemy**.  
The main goal of this project was to practice advanced modeling and calculation techniques in Power BI for analyzing complex metrics.

## 🧮 Key Metrics and DAX Calculations
In this project, several **advanced DAX techniques** were implemented, including:

- Creation of **dynamic measures** using `SWITCH` and `SELECTEDVALUE`.  
- Calculation of **accumulated metrics** (YTD, MTD, QTD).  
- Implementation of **year-over-year trend comparisons**.  
- Use of `CALCULATE` + `FILTER` for specific scenarios.  
- Optimization of relationships with **table modeling**.  
- Custom **KPIs** for decision-making.

## 📈 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard allows you to analyze:

- Temporal evolution of key indicators.  
- Period-over-period comparisons (year vs. year, month vs. month).  
- Dynamic segmentation through filters.  
- Accumulated indicators and projections.

*(You can open the `.pbix` file directly in Power BI Desktop to explore the model and measures.)*
